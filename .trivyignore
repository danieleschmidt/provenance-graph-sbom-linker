# Trivy Ignore Configuration for Provenance Graph SBOM Linker
# =============================================================================
# Ignore specific vulnerabilities that are false positives or accepted risks

# Development dependencies - these are not shipped in production
# Format: CVE-ID or vulnerability ID

# Example: Ignore development-only vulnerabilities
# CVE-2023-12345

# Node.js development dependencies (if any)
# These vulnerabilities only affect development environment
# CVE-2023-XXXXX  # Development tool vulnerability

# Go module vulnerabilities that are not applicable
# CVE-2023-YYYYY  # Vulnerability in unused code path

# Base image vulnerabilities that are patched in our deployment
# CVE-2023-ZZZZZ  # Ubuntu base image issue fixed by security updates

# Test-only dependencies
# CVE-2023-AAAAA  # Test framework vulnerability not in production

# Documentation: Add comments explaining why each CVE is ignored
# Format: CVE-ID  # Reason for ignoring

# Example of properly documented ignore:
# CVE-2023-12345  # False positive: affects Windows only, we deploy on Linux
# CVE-2023-67890  # Accepted risk: vulnerability in dev tool, not production code
# CVE-2023-11111  # Fixed: patched in our custom build process

# Note: Keep this file minimal and well-documented
# Every ignored vulnerability should have a clear justification
# Review ignored vulnerabilities regularly and remove when fixed
