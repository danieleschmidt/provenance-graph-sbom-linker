# Project Governance

This document outlines the governance structure and processes for the Provenance Graph SBOM Linker project.

## Project Mission

To provide a comprehensive, secure, and compliant solution for end-to-end software supply chain provenance tracking with cryptographic attestation, supporting NIST SSDF and EU CRA compliance requirements.

## Governance Structure

### Core Maintainers

Core maintainers have commit access to the repository and are responsible for:
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Releasing new versions
- Setting technical direction
- Maintaining project quality standards

**Current Core Maintainers:**
- *To be defined based on actual project maintainers*

### Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The TSC provides strategic technical direction and makes decisions on:
- Project roadmap and major features
- Breaking changes and API design
- Security policies and incident response
- Compliance and certification requirements

### Security Team

Responsible for:
- Security vulnerability assessment and response
- Security policy development and enforcement
- Coordination with external security researchers
- Security-related code reviews

**Contact:** security@your-org.com

### Community Roles

#### Contributors
- Anyone who submits code, documentation, or other improvements
- Must follow the Code of Conduct and contribution guidelines
- Recognition through contributor acknowledgments

#### Reviewers
- Experienced contributors who help review pull requests
- May be invited to become maintainers based on contribution quality
- Can approve non-critical changes

#### Triagers
- Help manage issues and pull requests
- Can label, assign, and close issues
- Bridge between users and maintainers

## Decision Making Process

### Consensus Building

1. **Discussion**: All significant changes begin with discussion in issues or RFC documents
2. **Proposal**: Formal proposals for major changes should be documented
3. **Review**: Community review period (minimum 7 days for major changes)
4. **Decision**: Core maintainers make final decisions, with TSC oversight for strategic decisions

### Voting

For decisions requiring formal voting:
- Core maintainers have voting rights
- Simple majority required for most decisions
- Supermajority (2/3) required for:
  - Changes to governance structure
  - Removal of core maintainers
  - Major breaking changes
  - Security policy changes

### Conflict Resolution

1. **Discussion**: Attempt to resolve through open discussion
2. **Mediation**: TSC mediates if direct resolution fails
3. **Escalation**: Final decisions by TSC vote if needed

## Contribution Process

### Pull Request Review

- All changes require review by at least one core maintainer
- Security-related changes require security team review
- Breaking changes require TSC approval
- Documentation changes may be fast-tracked

### Review Criteria

- **Functionality**: Does it work as intended?
- **Security**: Are there security implications?
- **Performance**: Impact on system performance
- **Compatibility**: Backward compatibility considerations
- **Documentation**: Adequate documentation provided
- **Tests**: Appropriate test coverage
- **Compliance**: Adherence to security and compliance standards

### Security Considerations

All contributions are evaluated for:
- Introduction of vulnerabilities
- Impact on supply chain security
- Compliance with security policies
- Cryptographic implementation correctness

## Release Process

### Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes or significant architectural changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, security patches

### Release Criteria

- All tests passing
- Security scan results acceptable
- Documentation updated
- CHANGELOG.md updated
- SBOM generated and signed
- Container images built and signed

### Release Timeline

- **Patch releases**: As needed for bug fixes and security issues
- **Minor releases**: Every 6-8 weeks
- **Major releases**: 1-2 times per year

## Code of Conduct Enforcement

### Reporting

Violations can be reported to:
- conduct@your-org.com
- Any core maintainer privately
- Through GitHub's reporting mechanisms

### Response Process

1. **Investigation**: Prompt and fair investigation of all reports
2. **Discussion**: With all involved parties when appropriate
3. **Action**: Ranging from warning to permanent ban
4. **Appeal**: Right to appeal decisions through TSC

### Enforcement Actions

- **Warning**: For minor violations or first-time offenses
- **Temporary ban**: For repeated or serious violations
- **Permanent ban**: For severe violations or repeated offenses after warnings

## Security Policy

### Vulnerability Reporting

- Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
- Email security@your-org.com for critical issues
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

### Security Response

- **Critical**: Response within 24 hours, patch within 7 days
- **High**: Response within 72 hours, patch within 14 days
- **Medium/Low**: Response within 1 week, patch in next release

### Security Review Requirements

- All cryptographic implementations
- Authentication and authorization code
- Input validation and parsing
- External integrations
- Container and deployment configurations

## Compliance Oversight

### Standards Compliance

- **NIST SSDF**: Secure Software Development Framework compliance
- **EU CRA**: Cyber Resilience Act requirements
- **SLSA**: Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts
- **SPDX/CycloneDX**: Software Bill of Materials standards

### Audit Requirements

- Regular security audits by external parties
- Compliance assessments for regulatory requirements
- Penetration testing for critical components
- Code review for security-sensitive changes

## Communication Channels

### Public Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: General discussion, Q&A
- **Mailing Lists**: Announcements, development discussion

### Private Channels

- **Security Issues**: security@your-org.com
- **Code of Conduct**: conduct@your-org.com
- **Governance**: governance@your-org.com

## Amendment Process

This governance document may be amended by:

1. **Proposal**: Any community member may propose changes
2. **Discussion**: Public discussion period of at least 14 days
3. **Review**: TSC review and recommendation
4. **Vote**: Supermajority vote by core maintainers
5. **Implementation**: Changes take effect immediately upon approval

## Acknowledgments

This governance structure is inspired by successful open source projects and adapted for the specific needs of supply chain security tooling.
