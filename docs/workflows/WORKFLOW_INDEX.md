## üöÄ GitHub Actions Workflows

### Manual Setup Required
These workflows require admin permissions and must be created manually in `.github/workflows/`:

#### Core CI/CD Workflows
- **`ci.yml`** - Continuous integration with security scanning
- **`release.yml`** - Automated release with SBOM generation  
- **`security.yml`** - Comprehensive security scanning (SAST, DAST, SCA)
- **`performance.yml`** - Performance testing and benchmarking

#### Specialized Workflows
- **`dependency-update.yml`** - Automated dependency updates with security validation
- **`container-scan.yml`** - Container image vulnerability scanning
- **`sbom-generation.yml`** - Software Bill of Materials generation
- **`provenance-tracking.yml`** - Build and deployment provenance recording

---

## üîí Security Integration

### Security Checkpoints
Every workflow includes mandatory security validation:

1. **Pre-commit**: Secret scanning, code formatting, basic security checks
2. **CI Pipeline**: SAST, dependency scanning, license compliance
3. **Pre-merge**: Comprehensive security review, DAST testing
4. **Pre-release**: Supply chain security validation, SBOM verification
5. **Post-deployment**: Runtime security monitoring, anomaly detection

### Security Tools Integration
- **Static Analysis**: Gosec, Semgrep, CodeQL
- **Dependency Scanning**: Trivy, Grype, Snyk
- **Secrets Detection**: TruffleHog, detect-secrets
- **Container Security**: Trivy, Clair, Falco
- **License Compliance**: FOSSA, LicenseFinder

---

## üìä Quality Gates

### Automated Quality Checks
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% overall, 95% for security modules
- **Code Quality**: SonarQube quality gate passing
- **Security**: Zero critical/high vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: No regression > 10% in critical paths
- **Compliance**: All license and regulatory requirements met

### Manual Review Requirements
- **Security Review**: Required for all security-sensitive changes
- **Architecture Review**: Required for major architectural changes  
- **Performance Review**: Required for changes affecting critical paths
