### Development Environment Setup

1. **Prerequisites Check**
   ```bash
   # Clone repository
   git clone https://github.com/danieleschmidt/provenance-graph-sbom-linker.git
   cd provenance-graph-sbom-linker
   
   # Setup development environment
   make setup
   make dev
   
   # Verify setup
   make check-tools
   ```

2. **Development Container** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   # Use devcontainer for consistent environment
   code . # Opens in VS Code with devcontainer
   
   # Or manually
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Pre-commit Hooks Setup**
   ```bash
   # Install pre-commit hooks

## Branch Strategy

### GitFlow-Based Strategy

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/***: Feature development branches
- **release/***: Release preparation branches
- **hotfix/***: Critical production fixes
- **security/***: Security-related changes

### Branch Naming Conventions

```
feature/USER-123-implement-sbom-scanning
bugfix/USER-456-fix-signature-verification
security/USER-789-patch-vulnerability
hotfix/USER-101-critical-memory-leak
release/v1.2.0
```

### Branch Protection Rules

**Main Branch**:
- Require pull request reviews (2 reviewers)
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict pushes to main
- Include administrators in restrictions

**Develop Branch**:
- Require pull request reviews (1 reviewer)
- Require status checks to pass
- Allow squash merging

## Best Practices

### Development Best Practices

1. **Small, Focused Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change
2. **Descriptive Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commits format
3. **Regular Integration**: Merge frequently to avoid conflicts
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
5. **Documentation**: Update docs with code changes

### Security Best Practices

1. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and tools updated
4. **Secure by Default**: Default configurations should be secure
5. **Audit Trail**: Maintain logs of all security-relevant actions

### Collaboration Best Practices

1. **Clear Communication**: Use descriptive PR titles and descriptions
2. **Constructive Feedback**: Focus on code, not person
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Document decisions and rationale
