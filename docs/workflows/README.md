# Workflow Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the CI/CD workflow requirements for automated SDLC processes.

## Required GitHub Actions

### Manual Setup Required
These workflows require admin permissions and must be created manually:

- **CI Pipeline**: Build, test, security scanning
- **Release Automation**: Version tagging, changelog generation  
- **Security Scanning**: SAST, dependency vulnerabilities
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image security analysis

## Workflow Files Location

Place workflow files in `.github/workflows/`:
- `ci.yml` - Continuous integration
- `release.yml` - Release automation
- `security.yml` - Security scanning
- `dependency-update.yml` - Automated dependency updates

## Branch Protection

Configure these rules in repository settings:
- Require PR reviews
- Require status checks
- Restrict force pushes
- Require up-to-date branches

## Required Secrets

Configure in repository settings > Secrets:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (auto-provided)
- `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN` (for container registry)
- `SECURITY_SCAN_TOKEN` (for security tools)
