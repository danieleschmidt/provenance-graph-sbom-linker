# Project Requirements

## Overview

The **Provenance Graph SBOM Linker** is an end-to-end software supply chain provenance tracker that links source commits → build artifacts → container images → deployed AI models with cryptographic attestation. This tool ensures NIST SSDF and EU CRA compliance.

## Problem Statement

Modern software supply chains are complex and vulnerable to attacks. Organizations need comprehensive visibility into the provenance of their software artifacts from source code to production deployment, especially for AI/ML systems where model integrity is critical.

## Success Criteria

1. **Complete Provenance Tracking**: Track and link every artifact in the supply chain from source commit to production deployment
2. **Compliance Achievement**: Generate automated NIST SSDF and EU CRA compliance reports
3. **Security Assurance**: Cryptographic verification of all artifacts and their relationships
4. **AI/ML Support**: Specialized tracking for machine learning models and datasets
5. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous attestation and verification in production environments
