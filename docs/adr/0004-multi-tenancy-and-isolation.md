# ADR-0004: Multi-Tenancy and Data Isolation Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The provenance system needs to support multiple organizations and teams while ensuring complete data isolation for security and compliance reasons. Different organizations may have varying security requirements, compliance frameworks, and operational procedures.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-tenant architecture with strong data isolation at the database, API, and cryptographic levels.

### Tenancy Model
- **Organization-level Tenancy**: Top-level isolation boundary
- **Project-level Sub-tenancy**: Within organizations for different applications
- **Environment Separation**: Dev/staging/prod isolation within projects
- **Team-based Access Control**: Role-based access within tenant boundaries

### Data Isolation Strategy

#### Database Level
- **Tenant-aware Queries**: All queries include tenant context
- **Row-level Security**: Database-enforced isolation policies
- **Separate Neo4j Graphs**: Option for complete database separation
- **Encryption at Rest**: Tenant-specific encryption keys

#### API Level
- **Tenant Context Injection**: JWT tokens carry tenant information
- **Request Validation**: All operations validate tenant boundaries
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-tenant rate limiting and quotas
- **Audit Logging**: Complete tenant-aware audit trails

#### Cryptographic Isolation
- **Tenant-specific Key Stores**: Separate cryptographic material
- **Signature Verification**: Tenant-aware trust stores
- **Cross-tenant Verification**: Controlled sharing of verification data

## Implementation Architecture

### Tenant Management Service
```yaml
tenant:
  id: "org-123"
  name: "ACME Corporation"
  plan: "enterprise"
  settings:
    retention_days: 2555  # 7 years
    encryption_at_rest: true
    compliance_frameworks: ["nist-ssdf", "eu-cra"]
    max_artifacts: 1000000
  
projects:
  - id: "proj-456"
    name: "web-application"
    environments: ["dev", "staging", "prod"]
    teams: ["frontend", "backend", "security"]
```

### Data Model Updates
- Add `tenant_id` to all core entities
- Implement tenant-aware indexes for performance
- Cross-tenant relationship restrictions
- Tenant-specific compliance policies

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Security**: Strong isolation prevents data leakage between organizations
- **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for data separation
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling per tenant
- **Flexibility**: Tenant-specific configurations and policies
- **Business Model**: Supports SaaS deployment models

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Increased system complexity and testing requirements
- **Performance**: Additional overhead for tenant context validation
- **Resource Usage**: Potential resource inefficiencies with small tenants
- **Development Overhead**: All features must consider multi-tenancy

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement comprehensive integration tests for tenant isolation
- Use database connection pooling to optimize resource usage
- Provide tenant-aware monitoring and alerting
- Create tenant management tools for operational efficiency

## Security Considerations

### Isolation Validation
- Regular security audits of tenant boundaries
- Automated testing for cross-tenant data leakage
- Penetration testing for privilege escalation
- Compliance validation for data residency requirements

### Incident Response
- Tenant-specific incident response procedures
- Isolated forensic analysis capabilities
- Cross-tenant impact assessment tools
- Emergency isolation procedures

## Operational Considerations

### Monitoring
- Tenant-aware metrics and dashboards
- Per-tenant resource utilization tracking
- Cross-tenant performance impact analysis
- Tenant-specific SLA monitoring

### Backup and Recovery
- Tenant-aware backup strategies
- Selective restore capabilities
- Cross-tenant recovery validation
- Compliance-aware retention policies

## Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Add tenant_id to core entities
2. **Phase 2**: Implement tenant-aware APIs
3. **Phase 3**: Deploy tenant management service
4. **Phase 4**: Enable tenant-specific configurations
5. **Phase 5**: Implement advanced isolation features
